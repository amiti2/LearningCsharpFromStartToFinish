This is my start to end learning course with Tim Corey

This project is to make Tournament tracker which is NCAA basket ball tournment style.

Scenario:-
your friend comes to you and asks you to create a tournament tracker. They are always playing games and want to determine who is the best. The idea is that you created a tournament bracket system where the computer will tell them who to play in single elimination style bracket. At the end the winner should be identified. Their model is NCAA basket ball tournament bracket for march madness
